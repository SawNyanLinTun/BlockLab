    toyTitle: 'Spin the cipher wheel', goal: 'Decode your friend’s note', toy: 'caesar',
    what: ['The number of places you shift is the <b>key</b>. Turning a message into code is called <b>encrypting</b>; turning it back is <b>decrypting</b>.', 'Anyone who knows the key can read the message. Anyone who doesn’t just sees jumbled letters.'],

    toyTitle: 'Try every key', goal: 'Find the key that makes sense', toy: 'crack',
    what: ['Trying every possible key is called a <b>brute-force attack</b>. With only 25 keys, you can do it by hand, and a computer does it in less than a millisecond.', 'Codebreakers also use <b>letter frequency</b>: in English, E is the most common letter, so the most common letter in a long code is probably E in disguise.'],
    real: 'Small keys are weak keys. Bitcoin keys are chosen from so many possibilities that brute force would never finish. You’ll see just how many in the next lesson.',
    quiz: [
      { q: 'How many different keys does a Caesar cipher have (not counting a shift of 0)?', o: ['5', '25', '100', 'Millions'], a: 1, why: 'There are 26 letters, so 25 shifts actually change the message.' },
      { q: 'Trying every possible key until one works is called…', o: ['Brute force', 'Hashing', 'Signing', 'Mining'], a: 0, why: 'Brute force means trying everything, one by one.' },
      { q: 'Which letter appears most often in ordinary English text?', o: ['A', 'T', 'E', 'Z'], a: 2, why: 'E is the most common letter in English, which is why codebreakers look for it first.' }

    toyTitle: 'Grow the key', goal: 'Find a key that can’t be guessed', toy: 'keysize',
    what: ['Computers store keys as <b>bits</b>: each bit is like a coin flip, 0 or 1. Every bit you add <b>doubles</b> the number of possible keys.', 'Doubling again and again grows fast. A few hundred bits gives more possible keys than there are atoms in a mountain range.'],
    real: 'A Bitcoin private key is a 256-bit number. Guessing someone else’s by brute force would take far longer than the universe has existed.',

      { q: 'Which key is the safest?', o: ['8-bit', '32-bit', '64-bit', '256-bit'], a: 3, why: 'More bits means astronomically more keys to try.' },
      { q: 'Why is a Caesar cipher easy to crack?', o: ['It uses letters', 'It has only 25 keys', 'It is very old', 'It is written by hand'], a: 1, why: 'With so few keys, brute force takes seconds.' }

    toyTitle: 'Feed the hash machine', goal: 'Make two fingerprints match', toy: 'hash',
    what: ['A <b>hash function</b> turns any input into a fixed-size fingerprint called a <b>hash</b>. The one used here is called SHA-256.', 'Its output is always 64 characters long (256 bits), whether you type one letter or a whole book. And the same input always gives the same hash.'],

      { q: 'How many characters long is a SHA-256 hash (written in hex)?', o: ['8', '32', '64', 'It depends on the input'], a: 2, why: 'Always 64 hex characters, which is 256 bits.' },

    hook: 'Mai sends her team the plan: “hello”. Someone sneaks in and changes just one letter. Could anyone tell? With a hash fingerprint, instantly.',
    toyTitle: 'Change one letter', goal: 'Spot how much the fingerprint changes', toy: 'avalanche',
    what: ['A good hash function mixes every letter into every part of the fingerprint. So one tiny change spreads everywhere, like one snowball setting off an <b>avalanche</b>.', 'On average, changing one letter flips about half of the 256 bits. There is no way to make a small edit and keep a similar hash.'],
    real: 'Each Bitcoin block stores the hash of the block before it. Change one old payment and its hash changes completely, so the next block no longer matches. You’ll build this in Unit 4.',
    quiz: [
      { q: 'You change “cat” to “bat”. What happens to the hash?', o: ['Only the first character changes', 'It stays exactly the same', 'It changes almost completely', 'It gets shorter'], a: 2, why: 'That’s the avalanche effect: a tiny change scrambles the whole fingerprint.' },
      { q: 'Roughly how many of the 256 bits flip when you change one letter?', o: ['1', 'About 10', 'About half', 'All of them'], a: 2, why: 'On average about 128 bits, half of them, flip.' },
      { q: 'Why is the avalanche effect useful?', o: ['It makes hashes shorter', 'Any change, even tiny, is easy to spot', 'It hides the message', 'It makes hashing faster'], a: 1, why: 'Because the fingerprint changes so much, tampering can’t hide.' }

    toyTitle: 'Try to run it backwards', goal: 'Find a hash that starts with 00', toy: 'oneway',
    what: ['Going forward is easy: input to hash takes a blink. Going backward is impossible except by guessing. That’s why hash functions are called <b>one-way</b>.', 'Finding an input with a special hash, like one starting with 00, also takes guessing. Each hex character has 16 possibilities, so two zeros take about 16 × 16 = 256 tries on average.'],
